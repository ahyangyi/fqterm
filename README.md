fqterm
======
This is a terminal simulator developed for telnet based online forum.

Originally forked from Qterm-Qt3, rewritten and ported to Qt4 by Curvlet and dp2 since 2008.

Now I'm porting FQTerm to Qt5.

TODO
====
- ~~Bug fix: Unable to use Ctrl key (FIXED using the code for Mac OS)~~
- Bug fix: SIGSEGV on exit
- Maybe something wrong with imageviewer
- Reconstruct the code
